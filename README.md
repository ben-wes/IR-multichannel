# IR-multichannel
Calculate multichannel IR files through deconvolution of a recorded sweep. With a jupyter notebook example (Python).

Download and copy all code to a folder in your computer. Open the jupyter notebook example and execute the first cell. 

Examples of mono, stereo and 4 channels recorded sweeps are provided. The original sweep mono file too. 

This code generates IR files with the same number of files than the recorded sweep.
