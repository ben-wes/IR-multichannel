# IR-multichannel
Calculate multichannel IR files through deconvolution of a recorded sweep. With a jupyter notebook example (Python).

If you do not have Jupyter, please install it: https://jupyter.org/install

Download and copy all code to a folder in your computer. 

Run jupyter from a terminal "jupyter notebook" , open the jupyter notebook example and execute the first cell. 

Try to run the examples using mono, stereo and 4 channels wave files of recorded sweeps. Some examples of these are provided in the folder as well as the original sweep mono file. 

This code generates IR files with the same number of channels and order than the recorded sweep you are using.
